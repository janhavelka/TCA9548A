If you discover a security vulnerability within this library, please follow responsible disclosure:

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue.
2. Email the maintainer at: `info@thymos.cz`.

## Scope

This library is designed for embedded systems. Security considerations include:
- No dynamic memory allocation in steady state (reduces attack surface)
- No network code (networking is out of scope for this library)
- No persistent storage (TCA9548A has no non-volatile memory)

## Security Best Practices for Users

- Always validate external inputs before passing to `Config`
- Use hardware watchdogs in production deployments
- Keep dependencies updated
